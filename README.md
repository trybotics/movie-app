# Advanced User Authentication and Integration Platform

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a comprehensive user authentication and integration platform within a tight timeframe of 48 hours. The application is designed to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development, leveraging core AWS services and integrating with external APIs.

## Features
1. **User Registration**
    - User registration initiates an OTP request for account confirmation.
2. **User Login**
    - Utilizes a database of user information for login validation.
    - Customizes the AWS Cognito/IAM registration to include advanced features like social login with providers such as Gmail or Facebook.
3. **Homepage**
    - Displays engaging content with two integrations, catering to both larger screens and mobile devices.
    - Integrates internal database query results using a GraphQL API request.
    - Incorporates a third-party API to demonstrate external integration capabilities.
    - Implements additional elements like webhooks for real-time responses to application state changes.
4. **APIs, GraphQL, and Lambda Functions**
    - Utilizes APIs, GraphQL, and Lambda functions for registration, login, and overall application functionality.
5. **Documentation**
    - Provides lightweight documentation detailing the application's intent and deployment procedures.
6. **Deployment on AWS**
    - Deploy the application on AWS for cloud-based accessibility and demonstration.

## Stack Elements
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js
- **Database**: DynamoDB
- **API Technology**: GraphQL
- **Serverless Compute**: AWS Lambda
- **Additional Tools**: Next.js (bootstrapped), TypeScript, Bootstrap (if used)
